Northern Guilds was a browser-based pixel-art MMO, and I was the lead developer on the project.  You can play the tech demo I created, here: https://billautomata.github.io/link/to/game.

I worked on:
* building a game engine with a custom render pipeline
* generate 2D character sprite sheets from animated 3D voxel models
* procedurally generate the environment


## Game engine with custom render pipeline

Using Pixi.js I created a multi-pass 2D rendering pipeline that has support for real-time lighting, shadows, animated procedural environment textures (grass, water), and animated procedural visual effects (fog).
